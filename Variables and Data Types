Variables in Python are used to store data values. Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold, such as integers, strings, or lists.
Understanding variables and data types is crucial in programming as it allows us to manipulate and work with different types of data efficiently

Example:

# Creating variables of different data types
number = 10
decimal = 3.14
text = "Hello, World!"
is_true = True
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Explainer:
We create variables of different data types: an integer, a string, a boolean, and a list. We then print out each variable to display their values. The output will be: 10 John True [85, 90, 88]
