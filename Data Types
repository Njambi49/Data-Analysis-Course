#Data types in Python refer to the classification of data items that determine the kind of operations that can be performed on them. Understanding data types is important as it helps us work with different types of data and perform appropriate operations on them.

# Integer data type
num1 = 10

# Float data type
num2 = 3.14

# String data type
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean data type
is_student = True

# List data type
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Dictionary data type
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Tuple data type
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Set data type
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# We define variables with different data types such as integer, float, string, boolean, list, dictionary, tuple, and set. We assign values to these variables accordingly. When we print out these variables, we see the values stored in them. 
#For example, when we print out "num1", we see the output as 10 which is an integer. Similarly, we see the values of other variables like "num2", "name", "is_student", "fruits", "person", "coordinates", and "unique_numbers" based on their respective data types.
