#ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION

#Arithmetic operators in Python are symbols used to perform mathematical operations. The addition operator (+) is used to add two or more numbers together, while the subtraction operator (-) is used to subtract one number from another. These operators are essential for performing basic arithmetic calculations in Python.

# Addition
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
result_addition = num1 + num2
print("Addition result:", result_addition)

# Subtraction
num3 = 10
num4 = 5
result_subtraction = num3 - num4
print("Subtraction result:", result_subtraction)


#We perform addition and subtraction operations on two sets of numbers. We assign values to variables num1, num2, num3, and num4. We then use the addition operator (+) to add num1 and num2, and the subtraction operator (-) to subtract num4 from num3. 
#The results are stored in result_addition and result_subtraction variables respectively. We print out the results of the addition and subtraction operations. The output will be: Addition result: 15 Subtraction result: 5
